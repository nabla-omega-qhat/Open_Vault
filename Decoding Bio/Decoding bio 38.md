- Bio uses quaternary system(Genetic code) 
- Usually trained for protein info.

	- Meta’s ESM-2/ESMFold is accurate as Alphafold, also can generate
	- Reversing this process to generate new sequence
	- Saleforce Research’s ProGen uses transformer-based LLM, startup

- Morderna’s mRNA-4157 provided first clinical evidence 
	- Currently, Phase III
- Approved personalized dendritic cell vaccine Sipuleucel-T
	- fell short
- now focus on neoantigen stratigy
	- find antigen from cancer cell solely <> not tumor-related antigens

# Why nearly half of americans with parkinson’s don’t see a neurolgist

- Care gap at Parkinson’s Disesase(PD) 
- also, 95% with depression or anxiety don’t see professional
- Myriad reasons
	- lack of standard diagonistic test
	- insufficient number of neurologist
	- difficult connecting symptoms to disease (ex:motor > neuro)
- How to care?
	- More accessible
	- Relivient care?
- emm..

- WGS can be more efective way to diagnose genetic diesease in *Infants* than trandtional method
	- WGS cost declines
	- effective than targeted-gene panel
	- interpretation is still in-development

- scRNA-seq to charactrize the AD pathophysiology
- Find pattern with developed computational method(CelMod)
- Find characteristic change in different cell subtype/groups across individuals
	- > Support AD is distributed pathophysiological process 
	- involved multiple cell types
	- Some subsets are associated with beta-amyloid deposition but NOT with cognitive decline
	- other subset are associated with tau deposition AND cognitive decline

- Editing efficiency between AAV(adeno-associated virus) and cell penetrant ribonucleoprotein(RNP)
	- AAV has several limitations : cargo capacity, immunogenicity, cost
	- Self delivering and cell-penerating RNP complex could avoid
	- test with Cas9 system
- Cas9 AAV diffused better across brain <> RNP edited near-injection site
- Both elicted humoral response, but AAV AB persited 90 days
- AAV treated showed elevated Cd3e level → adaptive immune response
- RNP showed acute microglial activiation, mitigated by endotoxin purification

- Landing point
	- defining biosecurity and risk
	- dual use research and gain of function research
	- biohacking and how that relates to biosecurity
	- interventions and prevention, ranging from PPE to scientific limitations
	- state of funding (non dilutive and dilutive) for biosecurity-related projects
