# B
- focused on nucleus mRNAs, not exporting into cytosol
- ALU element in RNA : transposable elements
	- can cause dsRNA w/ (IRAlus)
	- 3' IRAlus usually creates hairpin loop, stuck in nucleus(export x)
	- but certain 3' IRAlus RNAs localized in cytosol
- use J2 Ab, captures dsRNA loop > see 75%+ SINE/ALU element, mostly inversed
	- find 442 high-J2 gene, classifying based on alternative splicing/UTRs and location of ALU
	- Higher J2 = Higher nucleus ratio = lower expression
	- 
- CSTF2&T / MDM2 related, (also with p53 signalling)
	- MDM2 has IRAlus rich region at the alternative UTR(aUTR <> cUTR) area
	- CSTF2&T rel w/ alt. spl, KO of CSTF increas es expression/exportation of MDM2
	- MDM2 acts when dna damage-rerepress p53 signalling
- TCGA lung cancer: CSTF2 upregul, repress p53
- also brain cell mRNAs has long UTRs
	- >rel w/ paraspecle, ALS, NEAT1...


- mRNA therapeutic usage, but off-target effect + translational level is unstable(non-persistant)
- IVT(In vitro transcribed) mRNA
	- use UTR seq that interacts w/ protein or miRNA = switch of mRNA
	- and does not intrages into genome
	- ? if use RNAi cleavage as switch, degrading splitted mRNA mechanism?
	- somehow, extension after a-tail sequence suppresses mRNA, so add miRNA seq after mRNA makes miRNA-on switch
- combining circular RNA / self-replicating RNA to make mRNA system
- utilizing engineered mRNA is hard to
- build RfamGem, generative model rel w/ RNA family seq
	- test with regenerating RNA family seq, and functional ribozymes


- over viewing functional genomics
- prev years, decode bio by computer, now encode info by computer
- RNA-i utilization increases
- GATK biasing @ non-human var.calling
- -< pesudoDB / young.kaist

-  

- Moore's law <> eroom's law(@ drug discovery), Req more efficient discovery precision medicine
- Current : using LLM(they still uses BERT?) / develop low-param med. model(meerkat)
	- ZSL / reproduction from ai(GPT-4) still ok?
