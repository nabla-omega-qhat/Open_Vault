ZSL /random field/ MSA / TENET 
# A
- Build network of bethen ween proteins, simulate the effect of drug
- expecting drug-evading mechanic in tumor and re-stmulate downstream oncogenic path(increasing upstream / redirect pathway...) and mix
	- seeing traditional herbal drug effects

- mosasicsm in multicellulars
	- cloning divided stem cells at brain samples, sequencing the each cluster
	- to see mosasicsm / detect tumor precursor expression in 1-cell level(by cloning)

- A. seeing cell-free RNA at blood, build sensitive sequencing method
- B. classifying disease, comparing ML methods(LUNA-seq)


# B
- **NanoSplier**use squiggle info @ long read to enhance mapping(splicing junctions)
- Base calling error @ long-read sequencing data can contaminate barcode info(scRNAseq)
	- try the barcode list from short read seq once more
	- BLAZE locatese base @ long read and expect high-quality putative barcodes
		- Cluster & Ranking based on count, Edit distance

- Long read + Microbiome(metagenomics){skin, oral, gut...}
- but we only detect a bit portion of Microbiome 
	- Using ITS at rRNA as marker of bacteria taxonomy
	- =need long-read sesq
	- can discriminate plasmid-origin or chrmosome-orign dnas
	- 

- Structure expectation / Cryo-em
	- seq-to-struct Expectation : 2020 start, alphafold1 / trRosetta -> alphafold3/roseTTA AA 2024
	- problem at protein-nonprotein interactions
	- adding Cryo-em density map as input too. modelAngelo 2024, nature
		- at encoded data section at alphafold2

# C
- See Inflammation & Fibrosis = organs are replaced by scar
- finding molecules that can reverse fibrosis (@ mice models)
	- bcus after inflammation & injury, wound healing process being healed or fibrosis
	- why it become 2 outcomes?
- macrophage <> Fibroblasts interction is critical
	- @ Injury (simplified phase portrait)
		- threshold 이상의 fibroblast : grows and doubles macrophage level
		- specific level(Hot fibrosis) of fibroblast and macrophage 까지 증가
		- 만약 Macrophage가 없으면, 증가도 못 함(Cold fibrosis), only fibroblast
		- Macrhophage만 있거나 thr 이하의 fibroblast만 있으면 다들 감소( Healing)
		- both M, F supports each other and Fibroblast loops itself also(autocrine loop)

- Q. Then surpress macrophage is good for heal?
- A. of course not, sometimes can be healed but sometimes become serious. diagram is very simplified, can any trajectory is available. also M works role...

- Q. Is threshold of fibroblast alters by surrounding env or can be moveable?
- A. aging is one of factor, related with strength of autocrine loop.  reducing autocrine loop will push threshold more higher level, and sometime it will crashes over the level of Cold fibrosis level, it will inhibiting autocrine loop = increases healing basin. (no limited fibrosis level for healing) Xhu cell 2018 / Adler iScience 2020


-  experiment at mice heart, disease with heart attacks(MI) / Human with Liver Chrhosis NASH
- @ Heart attack
	- scSeq and see related gene with fibrosis autocrine
	- Lot of GFs are secreted and self-activate loop but GFs are related with others
	- one specific factor(TIMP1) rel w only autocrine
		- test with TIMP1 Ab injection, (<>Control sham Ab) then cancer does not go through tissue
		- = Inhibit/suppress expand of fibrosis, Miyara Tzahor Bioarchive2023
- Human need liver transplant, liber fibrosis spreaded
- Model mice : 24week liver toxin with high-fat diet
	- saw hepatic stellate cell, HSC2 / Neural tropic factor 3(NTC3) 
	- then inject 4 week of receptor of NTC3 inhibitor(Inhibiting autocrine loop)
	- it reverses chronic fibrosis
